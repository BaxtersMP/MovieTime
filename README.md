# MovieTime App

We're gonna learn some things and make some pretty cool shit. 

## Dependencies
You'll need some package managers.

- `npm`: JS related packages
- `pip`: Python related packages

## Setup

#### For the backend:
From the project root directory run:
```
# install `virtualenv` to setup a virtual environment
pip install virtualenv

# create your cirutala environment, `venv`
virtualenv venv

# activate your new virtual environment
.\venv\Scripts\activate

# install the remaining python packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### For the frontend:
From the project root directory run to install webpack globally:
```
npm install -g webpack
```

Use `npm` to install the remaining JS dependencies (listed in `package.json`).

```
npm install
```
